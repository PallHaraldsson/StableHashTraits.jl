# DATAPOINT: the recursive hashing itself, even without slowdowns from SHA
# buffers is substantial; this can be fixed by optimizing how primitive
# types are hashed (when `UseWrite` is set)

# DATAPOINT: hashing arrays of tuples vs. matrices has overhead
# because of the qualified name; if we can cash this string computation
# per type, we should hopefully be much faster (try that next)

# NEXT DATAPOINT: how much does sha's allocations slow things down?

# NEXT DATAPOINT: how does this work when working with many small structs
# (does the type hashing add a lot or is it mostly about the allocations?)

# NOTE: we can also probably further optimize by circumventing the `write`
# operations for primitive types that can be directly hashed

# If a cache of tuned parameters already exists, use it, otherwise, tune and cache
# the benchmark parameters. Reusing cached parameters is faster and more reliable
# than re-tuning `suite` every time the file is included.
